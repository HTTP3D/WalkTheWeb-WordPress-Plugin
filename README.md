Open-Source 3D Internet Metaverse - Multiverse - 3D CMS (Content Management System) to Build Games and 3D Shopping Websites Invented and created by Aaron Dishno Ed.D. CEO and Founder of HTTP3D Inc. - WalkTheWeb

I believe the Internet should always be Free and Available to all. Do you really want the big gaming companies to own the Metaverse and kill the full potential with censorship and advertising? Help me build a Free 3D Internet Metaverse by using and supporting Open-Source WalkTheWeb. I am calling for PROGRAMMERS, DESIGNERS, and ARTISTS to unite! So that Everyone owns the Metaverse.
