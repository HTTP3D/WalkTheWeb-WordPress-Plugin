Think of a 3D Store as a 3D Graphical extension of your current online store - traditional website. A 3D Store shows your online store products, short descriptions, prices, and categories with links that open your online store product pages and shopping cart. We do not do any transactions for your online store or shopping cart, only redirect users to your online store; in a new browser tab or iframe based on permissions and settings you choose.

The maintenance of your products, categories, images, shopping cart, and checkout process all stays in WooCommerce. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel! You have a store, we can help you reach more customers!

Your 3D Store is designed to be placed into many 3D Communities consisting of games, entertainment, amusement rides, animations, houses, businesses, and other 3D Stores. You maintain your 3D Store Building in one place and your 3D Store can be added to many 3D Communities. Read more at [walktheweb.com](https://www.walktheweb.com).


**Walk the Web Service is FREE**

Walk the Web is a Software as a Service - SaaS - for the purpose of creating, publishing, and hosting 3D Browsing Websites. 

3D Websites are FREE to have, use, edit, and operate.

You can create as many 3D Buildings, 3D Communities, and 3D Things as you like for free. Use this plugin for the wizard and basic settings or go directly to the [HTTP3D Editor - Walk the Web 3D CMS](https://3d.walktheweb.com) website Administration for full access to custimize your 3D Websites.

*Free for you and free for your visitors!*


*3D Community* https://3d.walktheweb.com/*PUBLISHNAME* and 

*3D Building* https://3d.walktheweb.com/building/*PUBLISHNAME* 

are always free and established when you create your 3D Website.

*PUBLISHNAME*s are on a first come first serve basis; with exception that we may revoke an official name if someone proves legal legitimacy to do so. Example: US Trademarks or copyrights. We do not allow vulgar or adult-only names or products. At this time all 3D Stores need to be appropriate for all ages; we do not cater to adult - 18 and above only - 3D Stores.


**Optional Premium Upgrades and Services**

Optional Premium Upgrades and Services are paid additions and services. They are not required at any time. 

HTTP3D Inc. - Walk the Web offers: 

- Custom 3D Website design services
- Use your Custom domain name for your 3D Website, like http://3d.YOURDOMAINNAME.com
- Secure SSL Certs for your custom domain names, like https://3d.YOURDOMAINNAME.com
- Service and Support Plans.

These are all *optional* paid services and upgrades.

Note that adding a *Custom Domain Name* like http://3d.YourDomainName.com works in addition to your original https://3d.walktheweb.com/PUBLISHNAME. You can have more than one *Custom Domain Name* displaying the same 3D Community.

All 3D Websites for 3D Browsing start with HTTP://3D or HTTPS://3D 

These are *U.S. Service Trademarks of HTTP3D Inc - Walk the Web* that signify and help identify that you will see a *3D Browsing* website based on a web address (URL).


== Installation ==

**Minimum Requirements for Plugin**

* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* WalkTheWeb requires WordPress version 4.7+
* WalkTheWeb requires WooCommerce 3.3.0+. This solely relies on the WooCommerce API, so it is easily tested and confirmed. If you see products and the links work, it is good to go!
* Your WordPress website needs to be running secure - https - have an SSL Cert. The SSL Cert can be terminated at a load balancer. This is used to make secure calls from the 3D Store to retrieve - read only - product information, product lists, product images, category lists, and products by category from WooCommerce. Without it, you can create your 3D Store at walktheweb.com directly, but your products will not show until it is set. We believe this is best practice for 3D Stores, online stores, and working with Application Programming Interface - API - calls to WooCommerce.
* WalkTheWeb plugin requires Internet Access - used to connect to the https://3d.walktheweb.com and https://www.walktheweb.com websites where your 3D Website is created and hosted. 
* JavaScript must be turned ON or Enabled in your browser. The Walk the Web® plugin uses JavaScript to show and hide various sections of the plugin settings page based on the tabs menu item selected. JavaScript also uses JSON calls to retrieve templates, synchronize with walktheweb.com, and save your settings.
* Allow Popups may be required for some of the test buttons. They open the test pages in additional browser Tabs.

You may also want to see [3D Browsing requirements](https://www.walktheweb.com/wiki/trouble-viewing-3d-websites/) to visit your 3D Store.


**Minimal Requirements for 3D Browsing**

* HTML 5 Compatible Browser.
* JavaScript must be turned ON or Enabled in your browser.
* Accepts Mouse, Keyboard, or Touch for 3D Browsing movement (Pan and Walk the view).
* Internet Access, it is Internet browsing!


**Minimal Requirements for HTTP3D Editor - Walk the Web 3D CMS**

* All of the 3D Browsing Requirements above.
* 3D Website Administration requires a computer with mouse - it is not fully enabled for mobile devices.


**Installation**

*Automatic installation* is accomplised in the web browser. To start, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type *walktheweb* and click Search Plugins. Just click *Install Now*. When completed, click Activate!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= What is 3D Browsing, Walk the Web, and HTTP3D? =
 
Invented by Dr. Aaron Dishno in 2012, the patented - serial number 14/499,668 - concept of 3D Browsing is like combining a first-person video game with browsing the Internet. This concept includes three main elements:

1. 3D Buildings or structures are websites.
1. Pan and Walk first person movement in, out, and between the 3D Building Websites.
1. Ability to Connect multiple 3D Building Websites to create 3D Community Websites or cities.

Furthermore, the concept continues with the ability to host 3D Building and 3D Community websites anywhere on the Internet, connect multiple 3D Buildings into 3D Communities, and our patented concept to load 3D Objects as you Walk near and unload 3D Objects as you Walk away. This is a core attribute of 3D Browsing. 

*Walk the Web* is our implementation of 3D Browsing.

*HTTP3D* is our name for the core technical framework that makes it possible: HTTP3D Inc.

= Can I change the 3D Building Design = 

Customizing your 3D Buildings and 3D Communities can be done at [3d.walktheweb.com](https://3d.walktheweb.com).

Using your Walk the Web Login, you can go to https://3d.walktheweb.com, *Login*, and select *My 3D Websites Admin* from the Menu.

You can now open your 3D Buildings, 3D Communities, and customize the Designs.

[Here are some step-by-step tutorials with videos to help](https://www.walktheweb.com/knowledgebase_category/tutorials/)
 

= How do I change the number, size, color, or position of Product Displays in my 3D Store? =
 
Using the [Walk the Web 3D CMS](https://3d.walktheweb.com) website, you can edit the product displays by right clicking on the 3D Object as you view your 3D Website. 

A box with settings will appear. As you change the values, you will see the updated version in your browser.
 
[Here are some step-by-step tutorials with videos to help](https://www.walktheweb.com/knowledgebase_category/tutorials/)
 
 
= Tell me more about the Wizard Steps? =

*Step 1* - The list of 3D Buildings - 3D Stores - is dynamically retrieved from the https://www.walktheweb.com website. This allows us to expand the offered 3D Store templates.

*Step 2* - The list of 3D Communities - 3D Scenes - is dynamically retrieved from the https://www.walktheweb.com website. This allows us to expand the offered 3D Scene templates.

*Step 3* - Your *3D Store name* is populated using your Blog Name by default. You can name each *3D Store* you create differently. The free *URL* naming all starts with https://3d.walktheweb.com/ and appends your chosen Publish Name. The Publish Name uses letters a-z, numbers 0-9, dash, underscore, and periods. You cannot start a name with dash, underscore, or period or use more than one without being followed by a letter or number. You can 3D Browse your 3D Community as https://3d.walktheweb.com/PUBLISHNAME and your 3D Building separately as https://3d.walktheweb.com/building/PUBLISHNAME

*Step 4* - *The First Part*, Walk the Web Permissions, is so that this plugin can create 3D Websites, list your 3D Websites, and read/write settings for your 3D Websites. 3D Websites are hosted at https://3d.walktheweb.com and the login will synchronize the settings and changes. If you log off of Walk the Web, this plugin will not see your websites but they will still be active on https://walktheweb.com. Although you can create 3D Websites and update 3D Website settings in this plugin, you can do the same as well as customize your 3D Building Store and 3D Community Scene directly in the admin on the Walk the Web website. 

[Here are some step-by-step tutorials with videos to help](https://www.walktheweb.com/knowledgebase_category/tutorials/)

The *Second Part*, WooCommerce API Permissions allow your 3D Store to retrieve WooCommerce Products, Categories, and Product Images. This tab only sets the permissions for the 3D Store being created. These settings are saved to make it easy to create another 3D Store. Use the "My 3D Websites" tab and edit each 3D Store to change or remove the WooCommerce Permissions. 

*Step 5* - When you click "Create It!", the plugin will securely send your WooCommerce keys and 3D Store settings to the www.walktheweb.com website to create your 3D Website.  

 
= Some Plugin Tabs are not showing? =

To simplify the view and relevant options, some tabs are hidden. For example, *Wizard* tabs only display during the 5 step *Create a 3D Store* wizard; *My 3D Websites* and *Premium Upgrades* only display after you have created at least one 3D Store.


**Wizard tabs**

During the *Wizard* steps, you will see additional tabs for *3D Building Store*, *3D Community*, and *3D Website Settings*. These tabs make it easy to go back to previous steps and make changes if necessary.


**My 3D Websites tab**

The *My 3D Websites* tab will appear after you have completed adding at least one 3D Store Website. 

After your first 3D Store Website is created, you can click the *My 3D Websites* tab to view a list of your 3D Websites with View, Edit, and Settings button links. This list is retrieved from [walktheweb.com](https://www.walktheweb.com).

If you log out of Walk the Web, the *My 3D Websites* tab will not show but your 3D Websites will still be active directly on [https://3d.walktheweb.com](https://3d.walktheweb.com). Log back in on the *Permissions* tab to view your 3D Websites. 


**Premium Upgrades tab**

The *Premium Upgrades* tab will appear after you have completed adding at least one 3D Store Website. 

The *Premium Upgrades* tab is designed to let you know some of the things HTTP3D Inc. - Walk the Web can do for you like custom design services, custom domain names, SSL Certs for your custom domain names, and Service Plans.

These are all *optional* paid services and upgrades.

Note that adding a *Custom Domain Name* like http://3d.YourDomainName.com works in addition to your original https://3d.walktheweb.com/PUBLISHNAME. You can have more than one *Custom Domain Name* displaying the same 3D Community.

All 3D Websites for 3D Browsing start with HTTP://3D or HTTPS://3D 

These are *U.S. Service Trademarks of HTTP3D Inc - Walk the Web* that signify and help identify that you will see a *3D Browsing* website based on a web address (URL).


**Help tab**

The lower 2 sections of the *Help* tab are from [walktheweb.com](https://www.walktheweb.com).

This makes it easy for us to publish new *Help* articles without a plugin update each time; intended to give you the best experience and support possible.


= Internationalization (i18n)? =
 
We have added the i18n - 18 characters between i and n - functions to the general text to support the basics for i18n. We are using the default WordPress i18n. 

Future upgrades will most likely address particular instances of translation.


= Contact Us and Support =

We take pride in supporting all of our users with the best service possible.
